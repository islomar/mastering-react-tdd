## Introduction
* No class components in the book.
* Functional components using hooks are simler than class components.

## Chapter 1
* `npm init`
* Install Jest: `npm install --save-dev jest`
    * I needed to install it globally as well: `npm install -g jest`
* Install React: `npm install --save react react-dom`
* Babel: JS transpilation between versions.
* JSX: JavaScript XML
* Tests:
    * Give your describe blocks the same name as the component itself.
